## Plan File Review Report

After displaying the Review Readiness Dashboard in conversation output, also update the
**plan file** itself so review status is visible to anyone reading the plan.

### Detect the plan file

1. Check if there is an active plan file in this conversation (the host provides plan file
   paths in system messages — look for plan file references in the conversation context).
2. If not found, skip this section silently — not every review runs in plan mode.

### Generate the report

Read the review log output you already have from the Review Readiness Dashboard step above.
Parse each JSONL entry. Each skill logs different fields:

- **plan-ceo-review**: \`status\`, \`unresolved\`, \`critical_gaps\`, \`mode\`, \`scope_proposed\`, \`scope_accepted\`, \`scope_deferred\`, \`commit\`
  → Findings: "{scope_proposed} proposals, {scope_accepted} accepted, {scope_deferred} deferred"
  → If scope fields are 0 or missing (HOLD/REDUCTION mode): "mode: {mode}, {critical_gaps} critical gaps"
- **plan-eng-review**: \`status\`, \`unresolved\`, \`critical_gaps\`, \`issues_found\`, \`mode\`, \`commit\`
  → Findings: "{issues_found} issues, {critical_gaps} critical gaps"
- **plan-design-review**: \`status\`, \`initial_score\`, \`overall_score\`, \`unresolved\`, \`decisions_made\`, \`commit\`
  → Findings: "score: {initial_score}/10 → {overall_score}/10, {decisions_made} decisions"
- **plan-devex-review**: \`status\`, \`initial_score\`, \`overall_score\`, \`product_type\`, \`tthw_current\`, \`tthw_target\`, \`mode\`, \`persona\`, \`competitive_tier\`, \`unresolved\`, \`commit\`
  → Findings: "score: {initial_score}/10 → {overall_score}/10, TTHW: {tthw_current} → {tthw_target}"
- **devex-review**: \`status\`, \`overall_score\`, \`product_type\`, \`tthw_measured\`, \`dimensions_tested\`, \`dimensions_inferred\`, \`boomerang\`, \`commit\`
  → Findings: "score: {overall_score}/10, TTHW: {tthw_measured}, {dimensions_tested} tested/{dimensions_inferred} inferred"
- **codex-review**: \`status\`, \`gate\`, \`findings\`, \`findings_fixed\`
  → Findings: "{findings} findings, {findings_fixed}/{findings} fixed"

All fields needed for the Findings column are now present in the JSONL entries.
For the review you just completed, you may use richer details from your own Completion
Summary. For prior reviews, use the JSONL fields directly — they contain all required data.

Produce this markdown table:

\`\`\`markdown
## VIBESTACK REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | {runs} | {status} | {findings} |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | {runs} | {status} | {findings} |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | {runs} | {status} | {findings} |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | {runs} | {status} | {findings} |
| DX Review | \`/plan-devex-review\` | Developer experience gaps | {runs} | {status} | {findings} |
\`\`\`

Below the table, add these lines (omit CODEX / CROSS-MODEL when not applicable; VERDICT is always present):

- **CODEX:** (only if codex-review ran) — one-line summary of codex fixes
- **CROSS-MODEL:** (only if both Claude and Codex reviews exist) — overlap analysis
- **VERDICT:** list reviews that are CLEAR (e.g., "CEO + ENG CLEARED — ready to implement").
  If Eng Review is not CLEAR and not skipped globally, append "eng review required".

**Unresolved-decisions status (MANDATORY — never omitted; must be the report's final non-whitespace line).** End the `## VIBESTACK REVIEW REPORT` section with exactly one of:

- the exact unbolded line `NO UNRESOLVED DECISIONS` (a **bolded** version does NOT count), when this review AND all prior fresh reviews have zero unresolved decisions; or
- a `**UNRESOLVED DECISIONS:**` header followed by one bullet per open decision, each naming what breaks if the plan ships with that decision deferred. The last bullet is the final line of the report.

This status is exempt from any "omit when empty" rule above — it is always written, and nothing may follow it (no CODEX / CROSS-MODEL / VERDICT line, no trailing prose). To count prior reviews, sum the `unresolved` field of the most recent fresh entry (within the 7-day window) per review skill, excluding the review you just ran; when that sum is N > 0, append ` + N unresolved from prior reviews` to the `**UNRESOLVED DECISIONS:**` header. Emit the `NO UNRESOLVED DECISIONS` sentinel only when both this review's and the prior count are zero.

### Write to the plan file

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

Use a single delete-then-append flow — do NOT replace the section in place. The "replace mid-file" path is what lets an old report get left mid-file when content was added after it.

1. Search the plan file for a \`## VIBESTACK REVIEW REPORT\` section **anywhere** in the file.
2. If found, **delete the entire section** — from \`## VIBESTACK REVIEW REPORT\` through the next \`## \` heading or end of file — to empty string with the Edit tool. If the Edit fails (concurrent edit changed the content), re-read the plan file and retry once.
3. **Append** the fresh report section at the END of the plan file.
4. Verify with the Read tool that \`## VIBESTACK REVIEW REPORT\` is the last \`## \` heading in the file. If it isn't, repeat steps 2-3 once.
