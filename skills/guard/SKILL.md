  Combines /careful (warns before rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push, etc.) with
  /freeze (blocks edits outside a specified directory). Use for maximum safety
  when touching prod or debugging live systems. Use when asked to "guard mode",
  "full safety", "lock it down", or "maximum safety".

# /guard — Full Safety Mode

Activates both destructive command warnings and directory-scoped edit restrictions.
This is `/careful` + `/freeze` in a single command.

## Setup

Ask the user which directory to restrict edits to:

> "Guard mode: which directory should edits be restricted to? Destructive command warnings are always on. Files outside the chosen path will be blocked from editing."

Once the user provides a path:

```bash
FREEZE_DIR=$(cd "<user-provided-path>" 2>/dev/null && pwd)
FREEZE_DIR="${FREEZE_DIR%/}/"
STATE_DIR="${TSTACKVIBE_HOME:-$HOME/.tstackvibe}"
mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR"
echo "$FREEZE_DIR" > "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
echo "Freeze boundary set: $FREEZE_DIR"
```

Tell the user:
- "**Guard mode active.** Two protections are now running:"
- "1. **Destructive command warnings** — rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push, etc. will warn before executing (you can override)"
- "2. **Edit boundary** — file edits restricted to `<path>/`. Edits outside this directory are blocked."
- "To remove the edit boundary, run `/unfreeze`. To deactivate everything, end the session."

## What's protected

See `/careful` for the full list of destructive command patterns and safe exceptions.
See `/freeze` for how edit boundary enforcement works.
